-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By running a series of test to look for compilation errors such as a JUnit test or a dependency check. These test will highlight any issues found in code in terms of severity and will provide methods to fix the issues. This is more efficent than manually reviewing the code, which sometimes can be a daunting process the longer it gets.

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

By reading the project rubric or the project parameters to determine what is needed and how to achieve that goal.

-How do I approach designing software?
Software design is incredibly tedious work and can be very confusing. To avoid this I try to use all of the resources I have avaliable to me such as previous classes work, my father, and other classmates. This is not something that can easily be done alone and the more people involved the more chances errors are caught. The more people involved also means more ideas, some of which may be more efficent than others.
